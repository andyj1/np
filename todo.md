    - selected which chip data to sample from,
    - reflow oven (trained using all chip data) took in PRE -> post

    (1) use each chip data: R0402, R0603, R1005
    (2) All chips together
- **PRE-SPI** as input, POST as output: reflow oven trained per chip
    (1) use each chip data: R0402, R0603, R1005
