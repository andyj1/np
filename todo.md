# TODO
previously:
    - each chip against a reflow oven model trained on each chip
    - reflow oven (trained using all chip data) took in PRE -> post

- **PRE** as input, POST as output: reflow oven trained per chip
- **PRE-SPI** as input, POST as output: reflow oven trained per chip

    (1) each chip data - each chip reflow oven model **3x2**
    (2) all chips data - all chip reflow oven model **1x2**
    (3) each chip data - all chip reflow oven model **3x2**
